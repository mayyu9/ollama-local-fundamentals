For the last 7 days I have been using this sunscreen, and I must say it&#39;s absolutely amazing with its ultra-light texture and quick absorption. Also, it has SPF 50 PLUS protection, which helps to shield your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, and it prevents sunburn and tanning. Best for oily skin.

Excellent sunscreen available in Indian market.suitable for oily skin.gitve cooling sensetion after application which is good,Overalla good sunscreen.

Lightweight, non-sticky textures n no white cast and absorb quickly really like this product n even not too hard on the pocket must have this suncream.

This sunscreen is absolutely amazing with its ultra light texture and quick absorption it feels like nothing on the skin yet offers powerful SPF 50 plus protection I have oily skin and it suits me perfectly without making me greasy or causing breakouts it genuinely prevents tanning and sunburn even after hours in the sun and the best part is no white cast at all truly a game changer for daily use and definitely worth every penny highly recommend it...

Few days ago i bought this sunscreen it provides gentle protection without irritating my skin...it is perfect for daily use on my skin...its also paraben free and lightweight....its texture is fluid and easy apply my face ....it absorbs very quickly in my face and gives a moisturizing skin

Not a good product. Fragrance is like Fevicol. Dont buy. You will burn your money.

I like it,not sticky

It's cheap but there's smell, like super glue 😅but not much,just light scent. What I like is it's not sticky on the skin, absorb really fast

I really love this sunscreen; it does not have a white cast, and even though it is the watery type, it covered my face nicely and was not sticky.

No white caste

Easily blends into skin, good sun protection. No white cast. Great under makeup

Glowing skin
